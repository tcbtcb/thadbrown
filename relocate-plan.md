# Relocate plan - draft 1 - 2018-03-14

## tech and location considerations
  - Found excellent, professional co-working space (green)
  - Internet access in general is excellent, at the space is fantastic (green)
  - Google Fi phone worked seamlessly on local network, no need to change number (green)
  - Travel is easy, approx 45min drive to airport with international flights (green)
  - Worked a day from the co-work space on vacation with no problem (green)

## flywheel integration considerations
  - I propose two VPNs active, one in a GCP instance that would be default, one Invensure account (all yellow)
    - I can configure a docker container with a permanent connection to that GCP instance, and do all ssh from there
    - In case that connection is not working, then use the Invenshure VPN and bounce to a machine in the office
    - When accessing front end of installs? Not sure how to go there. For ones without VPN it seems the same regardless
    - All data manipulation happes on cloud instance(s) in the Flywheel dev GCP project

  - Issue tracking (all red)
    - We have been too busy even to test our trial systems. I see Trello as a possible bridge system. Discuss
    - I have been trying to stay more involved in issues as they move to github
    - Ashley is managing the product issues/timelines brilliantly - keeping the two of us working together is critical

  - Team communication
    - I will edge toward attending more meetings at first (sprint/retro, anything implentation related, dev ad hoc) to find a good balance (green)
    - Per conversations with dev team, having a quicker, lower barrier to use audio may be worth exploring? Something even simpler than slack or hangouts? (yellow)
    - this link https://blog.codeship.com/4-tips-for-successful-remote-1-1s/ is a good one to consider, they run fully remote teams
    - I propose fairly regular 'meetups' with people if they can be arranged, i.e. lunchtime chats (green)
    - Per suggestion, will there be a number of planned return trips or a schedule for them? (yellow)

## HR/insurance/comp considerations
  - Health insurance is a huge issue. I'm getting conflicting information from different sources. That's something I have to learn (red)
  - Some people I have talked to have suggested that if I'm willing to have a legal address and pay MN taxes, I can remain an employee (yellow)
  - If staying as an Inv/FW employee is possible, I could carry equity, which I assume I can't do as a contractor (yellow)
  - Changes, if any, in proposed comp (red)
  - Immigration I believe I have figured out, but need to investigate more in country (yellow)

## Schedule (all yellow)
  - Two trade shows this year happen almost consecutively in June. 
  - I'd like some time before a final move in country, both to try work processes and to find a place to live, do the immigration groundwork, make sure I have a doctor, etc.
  - My proposal is I'll burn an awards ticket and spend much/most of May in country to do the above. Return late May and babysit trade show builds, then final move when that is finished
  - Whatever changes we agree on for HR/comp take place July 1, so there is some runway for that piece, which is needed
