I try not to talk too much about US politics here, since I don't really give a shit. But all of this doofus face presidential stuff I read today?

My sister, Lara Brown spent a lot of time telling me that El Trumpfantastic and his crew were just 'white male privilege' in walking, golfing form. That they were just impossibly daft and unaware of who they were. I find that hard to believe. New York real estate and Hollywood show business are not places lacking in back stabbers, treachery, and sycophants. And plenty of those back stabbing treacherous sycophants are white males with MBAs too, so it's not like you can get by on your single digit handicap and breezy entitlement. That shit is everywhere.

But here we are, with the innermost circle of the innermost circle, in a room with Ruskie spooks (not ex spooks, there is no such thing as a Ruskie ex spook if you're running a campaign for president) and a paper trail. So what is it?

The only thing I can think of is this. If you spend some time in the darker corners of the far world, you realize some situations are just asymmetric. The 15 year old kids who are mugging you in Colombia have already killed people. Same for the bouncer in the go-go bar in Thailand. And the Nepalese drug dealer who corners you after dark when you can't find a cab. And the Hungarian gangsters who catch you catching them muscling a guy out of the back seat of a car into another car facing the opposite direction on an empty street.
